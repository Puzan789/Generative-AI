      "Chief District Officer (CDO) of Chitwan, Indradev Yadav, stated that the Indian team is being honored with a thank you note and a review of their efforts. \"In the Security Committee meeting, we expressed our gratitude to the Indian team for their thorough review of the progress, methods, techniques and future possibilities that can be used during their mission. Their contribution to our disaster management and search and rescue operations has been invaluable,\" said CDO Yadav.\n",

      "The Indian team, consisting of 12 members, arrived in Chitwan last Saturday and began operations the following day. Equipped with sonar cameras and magnets, they conducted search and rescue operations in the Trishuli and Narayani rivers. Notably, even a 19 kg magnet brought by the NDRF was swept away by the Trishuli River.\n",

      "On July 12, two buses were swept away by a landslide and fell into the Trishuli River at Simaltal on the Narayanghat-Mugling road. Of the total 65 passengers, three managed to swim to safety, while at least 62 are still missing. To date, the buses remain missing, though 24 bodies have been recovered from the Narayani River to the Gandak Barrage, with only 19 identified so far.\n",
