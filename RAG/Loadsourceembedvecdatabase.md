## Load Environment Variables
We start by loading environment variables to securely manage sensitive information such as API keys.

## Data Ingestion

### Text Loader
We utilize the `TextLoader` class from `langchain_community.document_loaders` to load a plain text file. The loaded text documents are stored for further processing.

### Web-Based Loader
Next, we use the `WebBaseLoader` to fetch and parse content from a specified web page. The `bs4.SoupStrainer` is configured to filter the desired HTML elements by class, ensuring only relevant content is loaded.

### PDF Loader
We also load documents from a PDF file using the `PyPDFLoader`, enabling us to work with PDF content seamlessly.

## Transform

### Text Splitting
To manage large documents, we split them into smaller chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class. This helps in handling extensive text by dividing it into manageable parts with specified chunk size and overlap.

## Embed

### Vector Embedding
For embedding the document chunks, we use the `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` from the `langchain_google_genai` package. This transforms text data into vector representations suitable for similarity search.

## Vector Database and Similarity Search

### Querying the Vector Database
We perform similarity searches on the vector database to find relevant documents based on specific queries. This allows us to retrieve information that closely matches the input query.

### Using FAISS for Vector Search
We also demonstrate the use of `FAISS` as an alternative vector database for performing similarity searches. This provides another method for querying and retrieving similar documents based on embedded vectors.

This workflow shows how to load, transform, and embed various types of documents, and then perform similarity searches on the embedded vectors. This approach can be useful for a wide range of applications, including document retrieval, question answering, and information extraction.
